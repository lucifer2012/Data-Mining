# Data-Mining Project
This directory contains work for the project of data mining in 2016.

## Motivation
In general, restaurant prices are usually positively related to the local average household income. Our question is: Could we also observe similar phenomenon when it comes to hospital charges and local poverty rates? Namely, does a hospital arrange its charges according to its location? We utilize the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Provider Summary and poverty rate statistical data to build a model to explore the relationship between hospital charges and local poverty rates.
